		<h3> The internet is made up of a massive network connecting people all around the world. These networks are connected together via variations of internet infrastructure. This is the physical hardware, transmition media and software used to interconnect computers and users. There are many variations of infrastructure that connects us to the internet such as cables, telephone towers, power lines, wifi routers and many more. </h3>

			<h2>Power Lines <h2> 
			</center>
			<section>
	<center> Powerline networking is a technology that sits between wired and wireless. Rather than shoot network data into the air or through cables draped along baseboards, it uses the existing electrical wiring.
		<div>
		</div>
	This means that, with just power cables running to an electronic device we can both power it up and at the same time control/retrieve data from it.  </center>

			<h2>Wifi Connections</h2>
			Wifi is the abbreviation of wireless fidelity. It's a radio technology that allows computers and many other devices to communicate with each other without needing to be plugged into a wired network.
			<br>
			A wifi  network is made up of a wifi-enabled router or wireless access point and one or more computers or devices. Your router acts as the central 'exchange' for all information on your network and between your network and the internet. It takes this information and translates it into a radio signal which is then transmitted to wifi-capable devices and computers.

			Telophone Towers 
				</h2>
				Cell towers are usually built by a tower company or a wireless carrier looking to expand their network coverage or capacity. The purpose of a cell phone tower is to facilitate the signal reception of cellular phones and other wireless communication devices like telephone, television, and radio in a cellular network.
